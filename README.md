Hello!
This is used to keep track of all my random coding for transfer between devices.

Almost all of the file names are self-explantory, if not they are listed below:

Hello.py: An initial test of python, tuples and lambdas.

Test.py: Working with the hashlibarry to try and find a collision. Also working and learning timeit.

Theat.py: Learing multithreading and logging.
